# Baseball Injury Risk Analysis

This project analyzes baseball player movements to assess injury risks (shoulder, elbow, or safe) using pose estimation, joint angle analysis, and machine learning classification.

The system uses MediaPipe for pose estimation, calculates joint angles of interest (e.g., elbow, shoulder, knee), and classifies the movement risk level using a custom-trained TensorFlow model.

Users can upload baseball videos and receive annotated outputs showing the predicted injury risk overlaid on the footage, aiming to support coaches, analysts, and players in injury prevention strategies.
